# Blazor for Beginners

I created this project to follow along with the '[Blazor for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUJCA3DCzKT79Oe3kdKEceX)' video series by Microsoft. I'll be updating this readme with thoughts and notes as I go through the series.

I'm going through this series/project after the [ASP.NET 101](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oW8nviYduHq7bmKode-p8Wy) video series. My code and thoughts from that first series is [here](https://github.com/FaceToKeyboard/aspnetsample).
